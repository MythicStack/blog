Back-to-back updates? Wild. Maybe I should do that with the security side of things too. I'm not sure how consistent I'll be, but yesterday was fun and helpful. Not planning on updating the index every day though, we'll just do that every so often.

Rating. Starting the day off strong, I'll put an end of day rating as well I think.

I really want to have some "training" or whatever on white into the Caro-Kann. I hate playing it so clearly I need to learn more. 


Here's the last Caro-Kann game I played as white. Wild how ahead I managed to be ahead for the whole game. One blunder by my opponent and never lost the advantage.

Daniel Naroditsky is just my go to for all things Chess. Man is a titan in the space. I cannot get over how understandable he makes incredibly complex situations. His recommendation is the the Caro-Kann Fantasy variation and so that's what I'll be learning as my response to 1. e4 c6.


I blundered mate to a pawn. I also blundered mate to two bishops. This isn't the best day. It's really not,
