A Chess Blog? Seems strange coming from a security person. Especially one that doesn't keep up with the regular blog, but here we are. I'm really exploring chess for the second time in my life (the first was last year) and I'm quickly improving. I think I could improve more with some direction and some accountability. This isn't going to bring either of those things, but I would like to write some of my thoughts out somewhere and here seems like a good place to do it.

The progress tracking goes here, the accountability comes from the fact that I've signed myself up to the USCF and a live OTB tournament which should be quite interesting. At the moment I've barely played OTB at all so I have no idea how it's going to go. Below are my current stats. I'm really terrible at playing quickly.

Yeah, you read that right, 1,592 Rapid. I'm not sure how deserved that is, but it's enough games to be happy with it.
