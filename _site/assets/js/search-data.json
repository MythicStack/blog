My name is John, I’ve been in Information Technology for about 7 years (at the time of writing, 2023), my entire adult life minus a single year stint as a Marketing Analyst and a 4 month adventure as the Communications Director on my college campus. During this time, I have run the gamut of IT with experience in Desktop Support, Help Desk, CTI, DFIR, Vulnerability Management, and more recently the dark side of Red Team activities. Intentions . I have tried to write blogs before about my expeditions, but I’ve always dropped the ball on things fairly early because they quickly felt more like work than something fun to do write-ups in and document personal projects. That’s why I’m doing this differently, most visibly I’m not using a blog template for Jekyll instead I’m using Just The Docs. This was a conscious decision because I want things to be mostly free from the blog “timeline” sort of thing. I want to do write-ups on what I’m currently learning, programming projects I have in the works, exploits, maybe even some CTI sharing and the like. I don’t want to do posts about what’s going on, what’s my life is like, and how things are going with yada-yada-APT-626. That’s boring. This is for us both, you and me. I hope you can get something interesting out of this and reach out on Twitter if you’ve got input for me! . Contact . Twitter: MythicStack . ",
